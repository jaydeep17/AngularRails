# AngularRails
A bare bone web app using Rails 4.1 and Angular

I followed this [tutorial](http://start.jcolemorrison.com/setting-up-an-angularjs-and-rails-4-1-project/).

I have used `sqlite3` instead of `postgresql` as I didn't have postgresql installed.

## How to run it

```bash
# this will fetch angular
rake bower:install

# start the server
rails s
```
